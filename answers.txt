Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: Java doesn’t allow us to do this. Since “title” and “category” are String, they are basically the same parameters and the same object type. So if we add the constructor DigitalVideoDisc(String category), Java will not be able to differentiate between this and the constructor DigitalVideoDisc(String title).
